# NERVA Whitepaper
You can learn everything about the philosophy behind the NERVA project and the technology underlying our cryptocurrency on [About NERVA](about/) page.

## NERVA in a nutshell
At the NERVA (XNV) project, we believe that crypto should be for everyone. That's why we stay true to Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision "1 CPU = 1 VOTE".

Our a cryptocurrency has quite a few unique features:

* Solo CPU mining: Unlike virtually all other cryptocurrencies, XNV can actually be mined profitably with a regular CPU such as that in your desktop or laptop (as long as it is not too old). This is made possible by a unique hashing algorithm which makes GPU, ASIC and even pool mining unfeasible or at least unprofitable. Check out [Mining FAQ](guides/mining/) to learn all about mining XNV.
* Privacy: in contrast to many other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin), your XNV holdings and transactions are not only anonymous, they are truly private. Only the sender and receiver know each other's address, i.e. third parties cannot even see the amount of XNV you hold on the blockchain.
* Limited supply: during the main emission phase (2018 to 2021), roughly 18.4 million XNV were issued to miners. Since then - and forever - the reward for finding a block was reduced to 0.3 XNV ("tail emission"), which amounts to less than one percent of inflation per year.
* A great community: NERVA is not run by a corporation, but by people who believe in NERVA's values. We are constantly working on improving our blockchain network, mining tools, spreading the word etc. If you want to help the project, need assistance or just want to learn more about what's going on, be sure to check out our friendly Discord channel, where everyone is welcome: [Join Discord][nerva-discord-link].

# NERVA Documentation
In this documentation, you'll find information about NERVA, easy to follow tutorials, and help resolving common problems. Some additional developer-oriented documentation is available in the README files of individual repositories.

NERVA has both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI). Guides are available for both. Here's what you might be looking for:

* [More information about NERVA](about/)
* [NERVA Developer Guide](guides/develop/)
* [NERVA CLI Guide](guides/cli/) (with common issues & FAQ)
* [NERVA GUI Quick Guide](guides/gui/)
* [Ledger Hardware Wallet Guide](guides/ledger/)
* [Mining FAQ](guides/mining/)
* [A list of community projects](projects/)

If you can't find what you need with the search function, help is always available on [Discord][nerva-discord-link].
