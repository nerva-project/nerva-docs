For help using the NERVA software, refer to the Guides section. You can also read more about the project on the main website , and join our growing community on Discord , Telegram and Reddit . What is NERVA? \"Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote\" - Satoshi Nakamoto NERVA (XNV) is a pioneering proof-of-work cryptocurrency designed first and foremost to be truly GPU and FPGA/ASIC resistant. This means that NERVA can be mined competitively by standard computer processors - like the one in the device you're using to read this text. With the Cryptonight Adaptive PoW algorithm, NERVA aims to force miners to keep a local copy of the blockchain, incentivizing miners to run full network nodes which can meaningfully participate in consensus. This structure encourages solo mining, and helps avoid the hashrate centralisation that plagues pool-mined coins. By engineering the network to be as decentralised as possible, NERVA is naturally resistant to 51% attacks, and this resistance will only strengthen as the network scales. NERVA aims to take crypto back to its roots - away from corporatisation and huge mining farms, and back to the people - whilst incorporating the latest advancements in blockchain technology that allow for a fast, secure, private and untraceable financial network. Another unique attribute of NERVA is the accelerated emission schedule. NERVA launched in May 2018 and already the majority of the coin supply has been distributed to miners. All 18.4 million coins will be mined within 3 years. After this, like Monero and many other blockchains, a 1% annual tail emission (inflation) will exist to incentivise further mining. Unlike Monero, NERVA will be the first project to validate - or discredit - the reasoning behind this economic model, and by reaching tail emission first, NERVA will be both a test case and a prominent example of how to manage that vital transition. Finally, NERVA is fostering a strong community of likeminded enthusiasts, and you're invited to join. In time, we hope that NERVA will gain further traction and visibility in the crowded field of cryptocurrencies. While many projects rely on hype and marketing, we're focused on providing the tools for individuals and businesses to integrate NERVA into their services and accept XNV as an alternative payment solution, leveraging the benefits of our fast and stable blockchain. In the end, we may succeed or fail, but NERVA is leading by example in demonstrating the viability of a purer vision of cryptocurrency: a currency of, by and for its users, where anybody with a CPU and an internet connection can actively contrbute to and secure the network, with no centralised entities and no compromises. Motivations (Edited extracts from \"CN Adaptive, Nerva, and the Quest For Fair Mining\" , an interview with NERVA lead developer angrywasp) Decentralization Centralization is a major concern for all coins and the consequences are many. Giving too much hash power to an individual or pool increases the risk of a 51% attack, where a blockchain can be hijacked and manipulated for malicious purposes, and increases the fragility of the network. If a pool holding for example 65% of a network hashrate goes down, the network instantly loses 65% of it\u2019s hash power, struggling to validate transactions and progress the blockchain. This results in increased transaction times and difficulty in making transactions, causing a loss of reputation to the coin and frustration to end users. Centralization of hash power also causes the concentration of coin distribution. The vast majority of Cryptonight ASICs are operated by only a few companies in the business of making these devices. As a result, coins mined by ASICs are funneling the vast majority of their block rewards to only a small group of people, effectively centralizing price and distribution control and promoting cartel-like behavior among these individuals. NERVA's model of solo CPU mining maximizes hashrate distribution, making it much more difficult for any one entity to obtain the 51% threshold to stage an attack against the coin, while minimizing the network disruption caused by nodes going off the network. Distributed hashrate also has the added advantage of more equitable coin distribution creating a fairer system for all participants. Environmental Sustainability E-waste has in recent times become a major global concern. From the mining of heavy metals such as copper, to PCB and component manufacturing processes, to device assembly, pollution is present. Furthermore, the incorrect disposal of electronics results in heavy metal contamination to local environments and adverse health effects to the wildlife in these environments, as well as adverse health effects on the people responsible for the production and disposal of electronics. Through NERVA's ability to be mined on older hardware and by removing the ability of dedicated hardware to mine the coin, NERVA mitigates the issue of E-waste. Furthermore, scaling up hashing power in a CPU mined coin is more expensive, creating a financial disincentive for users to buy hardware specifically to mine NERVA, further mitigating the impact of E-waste on the environment. Anyone looking at the evolution of crypto mining over the last few years will have noticed an explosion in the amount of hardware being used for mining. GPUs have been sold out around the world and ASICs are being rolled out in increasing batches. This is creating an endless cycle of buying more hashpower to compete with other miners for coins. Besides the E-waste considerations previously discussed, we have witnessed an explosion in the amount of electricity being used to power these networks. It is estimated that Bitcoin alone uses more electricity than the entire Republic of Ireland. That is far from sustainable. NERVA on the other hand can be mined on the spare cores of your computer, with only a minimal increase in the amount of electricity being used by a device that would otherwise likely be running anyway. The Spirit of Satoshi It is worth remembering why crypto was developed in the first place. The driving force was to create a currency that could be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Across borders, free from taxation, unrestricted by government regulation and monetary policy. What people have been thinking all along, that banks are deceiving and stealing from the public, has been proven to be true. We need something else as a society. We need a way to transact with each other that bypasses the greed and corruption of the banking sector, and a way to manage our own money that no government or corporation can lay their hands on. Somewhere along the way, that vision was lost. Again, corrupted by greed and held at the mercy of an elite few. Only this time it isn\u2019t governments and bankers, it\u2019s wealthy ASIC manufacturers and rented hash services. Hijacking blockchains, stealing coins and controlling their price and distribution through excessive hash rates, well beyond what the average person is capable of. Once again, we have a select few corporations making massive profits acting in unethical ways to deceive and steal from the public. With NERVA, our aim is to take back control and show that a cryptocurrency is successful if it is owned by everyone. And by making it CPU mineable, we give everyone who owns a computer a chance to collect their own coins. NERVA is dedicated to existing in the same spirit in which cryptocurrency began. Challenging Conventional Wisdom Finally, there is some conventional wisdom we aim to challenge and some lingering questions that need to be answered if crypto is to have any future at all. It is said that a coin needs a large hashrate to be stable. NERVA challenges this wisdom: we believe that a stable coin comes from a highly distributed network and mitigation of network hashrate variance, by means of a robust difficulty adjustment algorithm and resistance to dedicated mining hardware. Monero, and by extension all Monero clones, also have a limited lifespan for mining. Every Cryptonote coin is on a ticking clock. One day, the Proof of Work will be done and the entire coin supply will be emitted. At which point the coin enters its \u2018tail emission\u2019 where only a very small proportion of the coin's original block reward is released to provide some inflation and replace lost coins. So if conventional wisdom dictates that block rewards keep miners incentivised to mine, and a blockchain relies on mining, then what happens when those block rewards are gone? Nobody exactly knows, because no Cryptonote coin has yet exhausted its emission. From a market and coin value perspective, what happens to the price once the selling pressure applied by miners is gone? Again, we just don\u2019t know. But we need to know. NERVA's unique approach to mining is important, but mining is only part of a coin\u2019s life. We need to be able to peek through that looking glass and see what\u2019s on the other side. For this reason, NERVA will hit its tail emission just 3 years from the first block, around 1 May 2021. This will make NERVA a prominent first example of how cryptocurrencies make that transition and what is to be expected in the life after mining. Technical Specifications Name: NERVA Ticker: XNV Hash algorithm: Cryptonight-Adaptive (Proof-Of-Work) Difficulty algorithm: LWMA Total Supply: 18.44 million coins + tail emission Initial Block Reward: 70 Emission Speed: 18 Block Time: 60 seconds Maturity: 20 blocks Premine: 1.05% (193,861 XNV) Ring size: 5 (fixed for all transactions) NERVA forked from Monero and had its genesis block on May 1st, 2018. The official NERVA blockchain explorer can be found here . Additional network statistics are available on Freeboard and the Nodemap . Premine A premine of 180,000 coins was included in the genesis block. Additionally, each of the 3 seed nodes in place at launch were each mining on 1 CPU core as a temporary measure to establish the network. The first 200 blocks were mined, bringing the total funds in the dev wallet to 193,861 XNV. This results in a premine of slightly over 1% of the total supply (pre tail emission). The premine is to finance the infrastructure to run the network for the years to come. These funds will support the coin by paying for exchange listings where required, server costs to maintain the seed nodes and provide bonuses and incentives to miners to support the network. CryptoNight-Adaptive The CryptoNight-Adaptive algorithm was developed for NERVA. The idea is quite simple: create a hash algorithm that changes automatically at regular intervals to break support for ASICS, mining pools, and GPU software, making solo-mining with a daemon and wallet the most efficient viable option. The initial release was based on the Monero v7 algorithm, with a few changes. First, the scratchpad was halved, like CryptoNight Lite. Second, we adapted the ASIC resistant changes from Alloy (XAO) which changes the number of mixing iterations every block. The number of mixing iterations is automatically incremented every block and reset every 1024 blocks. Many improvements have been made since NERVA launched, through several hard forks. A technical overview of an early version of CryptoNight-Adaptive, version 2, is available here , and is also discussed in the aforementioned interview with angrywasp . These resources are not up to date with the latest improvements, so if you have questions the best place to ask is in the development channel in Discord. Solo Mining NERVA prioritises decentralisation, to which pools are antithetical. Many pool-mined coins are vulnerable to 51% attacks, and pool operators hold excessive influence on the wider network. To avoid these problems, NERVA has sought from day one to be solo mined only. With solo mining, miner rewards are not as consistent as they often are with pools - depending on hashrate and difficulty, a miner may go unrewarded for an extended period of time. However, as pool rewards are still based on the percentage of hash power contributed, in the long run miners actually earn more from solo mining, due to lack of pool fees. Another potential upside to solo mining is that it incentivises consistent, rather than on/off, mining. This can help to limit sudden swings in the overall network hashrate. Regardless, our primary motivation is to avoid centralization. It should be noted that whilst it is difficult by design to develop a pool for NERVA, it is not impossible. Should a pool be developed in the future, the community and developer consensus is that a hardfork would then occur to make it ineffectual. For more information about mining, refer to the Mining FAQ . Pond Mining Pond Mining is a concept developed by the NERVA community for a peer-to-peer version of pool mining, which would avoid the centralization inherent in traditional mining pools. A whitepaper explaining the proposed system was published by community member Nithronium in November 2018. Pond Mining remains an area of interest but is not currently under active development. Hard Forks NERVA is a project under constant development. Sometimes, improvements require changes to the core network consensus algorithms; such changes are known as \"hard forks\". Hard forks occur on older networks, such as Ethereum and Monero, as well as newer ones, like NERVA. By design, hard forks make older software incompatible with newer software. To prevent senseless interference, in addition to consensus-based node banning, NERVA uses optimistic version blocking: every new hard fork version blocks versions prior to the fork. Will I lose my coins after a hard fork? No, there is no need for concern. A hard fork simply upgrades a part of the network software. As soon as you upgrade you will be able to transact again with your account. Does a hard fork mean that I will get extra coins, like \"NERVA Classic\" or \"NERVA ABC\"? Technically, your coins still exist on the old chain for as long as (unupdated) nodes are mining it. But no, there is still only one main chain. Hard forks in NERVA do not create chain splits, there is just NERVA. What if I sent coins after a hard fork, but didn't upgrade? Your transaction should be rejected in the upgraded network, returning the funds to your wallet. Once you upgrade to the latest software, you will need to rescan the blockchain from scratch, which will cause your wallet reflect the state of the upgraded network. To rescan the blockchain, simply restore your wallet from a seed phrase. Will the exchange support this hard fork? Yes. The developers are in close communication with every exchange that currently lists NERVA. Scheduled forks are communicated well in advance to exchanges to ensure everything goes smoothly. Previous Hard Forks Here is a summarised history of NERVA network upgrades. More detailed release notes for each were published in Discord. v6 , at block 45000 (1st June 2018).

If you're a less technical user and aren't familiar with the command-line, we know this can be intimidating at first. In truth, it's easy and you'll be a pro in no time at all. No prior knowledge is assumed in this guide, except basic computer skills. Let's get started! Getting started WARNING! As of the most current release when downloading the CLI package you will be provided with 2 versions of the daemon. nervad-aes and nervad-noaes . In most cases you will want to use the AES version. No AES is intended for users who have older systems that are not cabaple of using AES-NI. NERVA consists of 2 primary components: nervad is the NERVA daemon. This is your node, your connection to the NERVA network. nervad manages your network connections, the blockchain and is the software you can use to mine. nerva-wallet-cli is the wallet program for NERVA. nerva-wallet-cli manages your balances, accounts and transfers of funds. In order to make use of the wallet, nervad must also be running. There are other programs which are part of NERVA, but these are only used in specific circumstances. To get these programs, open the NERVA downloads page and download the latest CLI files for your operating system. Optionally, you can also download the quicksync file - this will save you a lot of time. Then follow the instructions below for your specific operating system: Getting started: Windows Tip for Windows users: Cmder is an alternative command prompt which improves the CLI experience. It is not required but is being used in the screenshots in this guide. Open your Downloads folder and extract the contents of nerva-vx.x.x.x_windows-x64.zip into a new folder. You can move this new folder wherever you'd like NERVA to be stored on your computer (for example, on your desktop) or just leave it where it is. (Optional) Move the quicksync.raw file we downloaded earlier into your NERVA folder. Inside your NERVA folder, click on the path/address bar at the top of the window (see screenshot) and type in: nervad.exe --quicksync quicksync.raw , then hit enter. If you are not using quicksync, simply double click on nervad.exe If you get a pop-up from Windows Firewall or any other security software, make sure to click 'Allow'. You are now running nervad. In the future you can launch it by simply double-clicking on nervad.exe , and you can launch the wallet by double-clicking nerva-wallet-cli.exe . Getting started: macOS Open Finder and go to your Downloads folder. Right click on the nerva-vx.x.x.x_osx-x64.zip file and select Open With Archive Utility . This should automatically extract the contents into a new folder with the same name. If you downloaded the file with Safari, it may have automatically been extracted. (Optional) Drag the quicksync.raw file into this new folder, and then open the folder. You should see an install file in here, but don't open it yet . Open Terminal (by pressing Command + Space, then type terminal and hit enter). In the terminal window, we are going to type in sudo followed by a space. Now drag the install file from Finder into your Terminal window, and it should automatically add the location of the file to our command. Then hit enter to run the command. You will be prompted for your Mac user account password. Type your password, and then hit enter. No dots will appear as you type the password - this is normal. If at this or any point you receive a warning about running software from an unidentified developer, you need to open your System Preferences Security Privacy General, and hit allow at the bottom of that page. If nothing happened except a new line in the terminal, the installation was successful. Now we will type another command: nervad --quicksync followed by a space and this time drag the quicksync.raw file into Terminal. Now hit enter. ( If you are not using quicksync, simply type nervad ) You are now running nervad. In the future you can relaunch it by typing nervad in any Terminal window, and can launch the wallet with the command nerva-wallet-cli . You can open multiple terminals by clicking Shell New Terminal from the top menu bar. Getting started: Linux Download and unzip the Linux binaries into a new directory, and move the quicksync.raw file there. Run the command ./nervad --quicksync quicksync.raw ( If you are not using quicksync, simply run ./nervad ) You are now running nervad. In the future you can relaunch it via the ./nervad command. You can launch the wallet with the command ./nerva-wallet-cli . Running the daemon Once all the necessary processes have booted up, the NERVA daemon will check how far along your copy of the blockchain is. If it finds that your copy of the database has not caught up to the current block, it will tell you how far behind you are. After that, it will start synchronizing your chain with those of the peers you connect to. Synchronizing refers to the daemon keeping an up to date copy of the blockchain on your computer. Your daemon must have a full copy of the blockchain to work properly. You cannot mine and your wallet balance will not be accurate unless the blockchain is synchronized. This process will take a while. If you have opted to use the quicksync feature, the sync should be completed in less than 20 minutes on most computers. Once your daemon has synchronised, you will receive a SYNCHRONIZED OK message and you then are ready to start using NERVA. Understanding daemon messages Every announcement has a time stamp : YYYY-MM-DD followed by HH:MM:SS.sss (yes, miliseconds). INFO ( I ) is a log level indicator. Other possibilities are WARNING ( W ) and ERROR ( E ). Only errors require you to take action, as they indicate a problem. It is usually safe to ignore warnings. The message explains the event of interest. If you run nervad with an increased log level , you'll see a lot of messages while the daemon starts up all the necessary processes. The first few lines initialize the CryptoNote core module, which is the base protocol of all CryptoNote coins. The lines after that are all about booting up the servers required for accepting network requests and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests, which basically means the peer-to-peer stuff on the network or in simpler terms: this lets your computer talk to other computers on the NERVA network. Creating a wallet If you wish to store your funds on a Ledger hardware wallet, refer to the Ledger guide . Once you have synchronized the blockchain, you'll need to create a wallet so that can you receive and spend NERVA. This is done through nerva-wallet-cli. The wallet creation process is straightforward. After launching nerva-wallet-cli, you'll be asked to specify a wallet name. You should use only alphanumeric characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9). Then confirm wallet creation by typing Yes and hitting enter. Next you'll be asked for a wallet password. The password you enter will be used to encrypt your wallet data, so that even if somebody else had access to your computer, your funds would remain safe (at least until/unless they brute forced the password). You can skip providing a password by just hitting enter, but it's recommended to enter a secure random password at this stage. You'll be required to enter this password whenever you open your wallet, when you spend coins and (by default) also when you receive coins. Nothing will appear on the screen as you type your password - this is normal. Finally, specify your language (1 for English) and your wallet is all set up. Backing up your seed It is extremely important that you write down your unique 25 word seed phrase. These words are all that is needed to access your funds should your wallet file become lost or corrupted. DO NOT save the seed on your computer or any unencrypted digital storage. Ideally you should not print it either. The generally recommended method is to write your seed in block letters on old fashioned paper, and store it in a secure place. It may seem obvious but is worth repeating: NEVER share your seed with anybody else. Your seed is the key to your funds, and anybody who has your seed can steal your funds. You can optionally choose to backup your private view key and spend key. Only the seed phrase is required. You can view these at a later date with the commands seed , viewkey and spendkey . What are all these seeds/keys? There are 2 sets of keypairs in NERVA. The view key and spend key. Each pair consists of a public key and a private key. To place it in basic terms, the public spend and view keys are combined to form your wallet address. People use that information to send you funds. However due to the private nature of Monero and its forks (NERVA included), funds are not actually sent to you. The transaction is encrypted with your public key and stored in the blockchain. Your wallet then scans the blockchain with your private keys to figure out which of these encrypted transactions belongs to you. When it finds a matching transaction, the information is stored in your wallet and your balance is updated. Therefore, your wallet file is really nothing more than a cache for storing information about your transactions on the blockchain. The real work is done by the view and spend keys. And this is why it is of absolute importance to keep a copy of these keys safe. Without them, you cannot find your transactions on the blockchain and they are gone forever. The 25 word mnemonic seed is the private view and spend keys combined in a human readable form. It is a convenience option to recover your wallet. Both the CLI and GUI wallet will provide you a way to recover your funds from the seed, or from the private keys. Restoring a wallet You can open a previously created wallet by simply launching nerva-wallet-cli and typing the name of the wallet. If the wallet file was lost or corrupted, or you have forgotten the password, you will need to restore the wallet through one of these methods: Restore from 25 word mnemonic seed You can restore from seed with the following command: nerva-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet Set a name for your wallet, then carefully input your 25 word seed. You will be asked to enter the seed encryption passphrase - usually there is no passphrase, so just hit enter. Then enter a strong password for the wallet, as if you were creating a new one. Finally you'll be asked to enter a block height to scan your wallet from. If you're not sure, just press enter again. The wallet will then be regenerated. Restore from private spend key You can restore from the spend key with the following command: nerva-wallet-cli --generate-from-spend-key name Replace name with the name you'd like your restored wallet to have. You'll be prompted to enter your (secret) spend key. Carefully type it in. Next choose a strong password for your wallet and confirm it, then choose your language (1 for English). Finally you'll be asked to enter a block height to scan your wallet from. If you're not sure, just press enter again. The wallet will then be regenerated. Basic usage In both nervad and nerva-wallet-cli, you can see a full list of commands with help , and more information on a given command with help command . Some commands are explained in further detail below. You can view your public address (that you can receive funds to) with the wallet command address . You can see your current balance with balance . Making transactions No currency is complete without a way to spend it. nerva-wallet-cli provides the means to transfer funds to other accounts. The most basic way to send funds is to use the command: transfer address amount , where address is the address to send XNV to and amount is the amount to send. After you press ENTER, you will be informed of the fee and asked to confirm. Confirm the transaction to send. There are other options when it comes to sending XNV. The following command includes some of the optional features: transfer priority address amount payment_id Additional to address and amount , you now also have a priority which specifies the importance of the transaction and a payment_id which may optionally be required by the receiving party. There are 4 priority levels: default low medium high Higher priority transactions are processed before lower priority transactions, however they cost more in fees. In most cases, the default priority (automatically set when you omit the priority) is suitable. Transaction fees collected are placed into the next block and included as part of the block reward for the miner of the next block. The payment ID is an optional identifier used to label a transaction. This is most often used to distinguish who is sending funds to a particular wallet. For example, exchanges listing NERVA have only one address, and use the payment ID to determine which user is depositing funds to the exchange. Usually, exchanges use an integrated address . Viewing transactions You can use the show_transfers command in nerva-wallet-cli to see your transaction history (both sent and received). Your wallet will automatically detect any new transactions, but if it doesn't (for example if it previously lost connection to nervad) you can manually refresh it with the refresh command. You can also fully rescan the blockchain with the command rescan_bc which will usually resolve any wallet issues. Checking node status In nervad, type the following command: status This will produce an output such as: Height: 93582/93582 (100.0%) on mainnet, mining at 607 H/s, net hash 365.58 kH/s, v6, up to date, 8(out)+0(in) connections, uptime 0d 5h 35m 18s This shows you the height, network you are connected to, hash rate, number of connections and uptime. This comprises most information a user might require about the NERVA network. Exiting You should always use the exit command to safely close both nervad and nerva-wallet-cli. Mining Mining is the process of validating transactions on the blockchain. The reward for your work is paid out in NERVA (XNV). If you are first to unlock the block, you get the coins. There are two ways to start mining: In nerva-wallet-cli , with the command start_mining threads - this will mine to your wallet address In nervad , with the command start_mining address threads You can also set nervad to mine automatically after launching, with the command: nervad --start-mining address --mining-threads threads If you do not specify a number of CPU threads to mine on, the daemon will automatically detect the optimal number of threads, but you may get better results from experimentation, as each hardware configuration is different. If you have no idea what a thread is, or have other questions about mining, refer to the Mining FAQ . Things to consider FAQ Concerning Nethash As mentioned earlier, when you type status in the daemon one of the things you see is the network's total hashrate; this value is only an estimate, and so it can depart from the true network hashrate, which cannot be directly observed. The nethash value you see derives from the recent rate at which blocks have been produced. Consequently, luck may cause the nethash reading to fluctuate substantially, even if the real network hashrate hasn't changed at all. An example: Blocks get found quickly, so it looks like the total nethash has increased; the estimate adjusts to compensate, then blocks slow down and it looks like nethash has decreased. Concerning Addresses NERVA has different types of addresses: A normal address for NERVA starts with NV . If you send coins to an exchange or a merchant you have to add a payment ID to this kind of address. Due to the untraceability of transactions, they will need this to know the payment comes from you. Alternatively, you can use an integrated address which starts with Niz . Don't ask how the Z got there. This is likely a wrongly configured prefix; when the chain launched with it, it stayed forever. Integrated addresses don't require a separate payment ID because it is...integrated into it. A third kind of address is a subaddress . This is what you get if you create more than one address for a wallet. Subaddresses start with NS . Subaddresses are the next generation of privacy enhancing address. To summarize: normal address : starts with NV , can be combined with payment ID integrated address : starts with Niz , has an integrated payment ID, typically used by exchanges. subaddress : starts with NS Concerning Chain Reorganizations: Nodes always broadcast what they think is the right block height but this is not necessarily the correct one. It used to happen a lot after hardforks that outdated nodes kept broadcasting their bad chain top block as the right one. This is no longer an issue (since the CN-A v3 algorithm) because outdated nodes now get blocked as soon as they send a bad block or announce their invalid version height. The other possibility is that two miners find a block simultaneously (a so called uncle block situation) and both get half the network behind 'their' chain. This creates a temporary fork and happens every so often (daily). It goes like this: Miner A and Miner B find a block almost simultaneously and start broadcasting their solution. The nodes that think block A is the right block mine as if it was and the nodes that think block B is the right one also mine as if Miner B's chain is the right one. Both chains diverge for a time until the chain is able to determine which one has the most nodes working on it (calculated from cumulative difficulty). That becomes the right chain and everyone on the other chain gets their node \"reorganised\" onto the right one. Concerning Seed Nodes The seed nodes are the basic nodes in the NERVA network. When you start your daemon for the first time, it will connect to the seed nodes to get started. Seed nodes are really nothing special: They are IP addresses hardcoded into the daemon, so if you run out of connections, you know at least a few nodes you can contact. NERVA developers are actively looking at alternate ways of getting a list of nodes you can connect to because seed nodes introduce a certain level of centralization. DNS-based node lists and port scanning to find other nodes are several of the options that are being considered. Concerning the Nodemap NERVA has a nodemap which shows you approximately where the full nodes are in the world. Isn't that bad for privacy? First and foremost, there is the possibility to opt-out by starting the daemon with the --no-analytics flag. Besides that, no personally identifiable information is being stored and you always have the option to run the node from behind a proxy or VPN if you are worried. The analytics aren't really analytics either: it's a simple matter of geolocating IP addresses which anyone could do with their own node. In fact, a core member (syzygy) playing around with this is exactly how the node map came to be. The functionality was later added to explicitly support it in the daemon. Log location By default, log files are stored in the following locations: C:\\ProgramData\\nerva on Windows ~/.nerva on Linux and macOS You can change this with the --log-file launch paramater if you so wish. Changing log level If you're having a problem but aren't receiving any error or warning messages in the terminal or logs, it can be a bit of a guessing game to find out what is going on. Increasing the log level will output much more information, which can help to identify issues. You can do this in both nervad and nerva-wallet-cli, with the command set_log level , or by launching them with the parameter --log-level level . Replace level with a number from 0-4, with 0 being minimal information, and 4 being a constant stream of text. It is recommended to increment the number by 1 until you find what you are looking for. How do I update? Download the latest version and simply overwrite the existing files. How do I sync even faster? Syncing the NERVA blockchain from scratch is relatively fast, but there are several ways to speed it up significantly. The preferred method is to use quicksync , as demonstrated in earlier in this guide. This is a small file which, once downloaded, will allow you to sync the full blockchain in around 20 minutes, with the command: nervad --quicksync path/to/quicksync.raw . An even faster method, especially useful if deploying NERVA to multiple machines, is to download the latest full bootstrap and import this via the command: nerva-blockchain-import --input-file path/to/mainnet.raw --verify 0 Excluding the time to download the bootstrap, the import process should take less than a minute. You'll need to run the import command twice to sync to the top block of the bootstrap. You then only need to sync the remaining blocks that weren't included in the bootstrap file. What's the difference between NERVA's quicksync method and a regular bootstrap? The bootstrap is a copy of all the blocks up to a certain point; it is possible to enable full block verification with a bootstrap file if you wish to do so. Quicksync, on the other hand, is a binary file that contains all of the chain's block hashes up to a certain height. While quicksyncing, the block hashes are compared to what is in the quicksync file rather than being computed on the fly. That saves your daemon from hashing each block itself, which is what makes the synchronization quick. It doesn't fully bypass the verification process, only the slow part of hashing the block. What are node blocked messages? Other nodes can be blocked from connecting to your node if they have mined an invalid block (i.e. are on a forked chain) or have possibly tampered with the code. You may also be blocked for being on a forked chain as well. NERVA also has specific measures in place to block other nodes if they report an incompatible software version (i.e. outdated software) or fail to report their version to the other nodes. These measures exist to protect the integrity of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes are updated to a compatible version of the NERVA software. If you are worried about these errors, you should type status into your node. If you have connections to the network, then there is nothing to worry about. If it reports you have no connections, then it is highly probable that it is in fact your node that is blocked from the network. Updating NERVA Each new release of the software brings new features, improvements or optimisations. It's recommended to always keep your node up to date with the latest version. Occasionally, hard forks occur which makes updating your node mandatory. To update, simply close all NERVA processes, download the new binaries, extract them and copy your wallet files from the old version to the new. Alternatively you can paste the new binaries into your existing NERVA directory, overwriting the old contents. Before updating, you should ensure that your wallet seed phrase is backed up, just in case something goes wrong. Common issues Created a new wallet but transactions or found blocks do not display If this happens please use the command rescan_bc . If this does not help the current solutuion is to restore your wallet from its seed phrase. This will fix the issue. AES-NI error Use the noaes version of nervad. nervad will not launch or crashes after launching The most common reason this occurs is if you already have another instance of nervad running in the background. If in doubt, try restarting your computer. If this did not fix the issue, check the logs for more information. Node not syncing There are a number of reasons this can occur. Following these steps should resolve it in most cases: Restart the daemon Restart your computer Check your system's clock. If you clock's time is off from the network time by more than the future time limit, the local daemon will reject the block. Ensure you are running the latest version of NERVA. It is possible your blockchain is corrupted or you are on a forked chain. Run this command: nerva-blockchain-import --pop-blocks 1000 , then restart the daemon again. You may have been blocked by the seed nodes. Waiting or changing your IP should resolve this, or you can unblock yourself in the #atom channel in Discord. If you're still having issues, Discord is the right place to be so we can investigate further. Wallet created prior to v0.1.5.6 will not open You'll need to restore from seed. MDB_READERS_FULL error Launch nervad with the flag: --db-readers 256 Increase this number until you don't get the error any more. (macOS) 'lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _clock_gettime' The Mac CLI is built on Mojave. The minimum required version for running the Mac CLI is reported as Sierra. There is no plan to support versions older than that for mining on Mac. If you have git installed, you may also try building from source: git clone --recursive https://bitbucket.org/nerva-project/nerva ./nerva/builder/mac (Linux) nerva-wallet-cli hangs on launch Try launching the wallet with the flag --daemon-ssl disabled . Getting help If you have questions that are not answered here or with the help command, remember that NERVA is very closely related to Monero, a larger project with more comprehensive documentation. Sometimes you'll be able to find an answer (quickly) by googling your question with 'monero' appended. Otherwise, please reach out on Discord (in the #cli-help channel), our community is active and helpful.","title":"CLI Guide"},{"location":"guides/cli/#nerva-cli-guide","text":"Running NERVA from the command-line gives you the most features, flexibility and stability, and is recommended for crypto veterans and newbies alike.

Your daemon must have a full copy of the blockchain to work properly. You cannot mine and your wallet balance will not be accurate unless the blockchain is synchronized. This process will take a while. If you have opted to use the quicksync feature, the sync should be completed in less than 20 minutes on most computers.

You can skip providing a password by just hitting enter, but it's recommended to enter a secure random password at this stage. You'll be required to enter this password whenever you open your wallet, when you spend coins and (by default) also when you receive coins.

The view key and spend key. Each pair consists of a public key and a private key. To place it in basic terms, the public spend and view keys are combined to form your wallet address. People use that information to send you funds. However due to the private nature of Monero and its forks (NERVA included), funds are not actually sent to you. The transaction is encrypted with your public key and stored in the blockchain. Your wallet then scans the blockchain with your private keys to figure out which of these encrypted transactions belongs to you. When it finds a matching transaction, the information is stored in your wallet and your balance is updated. Therefore, your wallet file is really nothing more than a cache for storing information about your transactions on the blockchain. The real work is done by the view and spend keys. And this is why it is of absolute importance to keep a copy of these keys safe. Without them, you cannot find your transactions on the blockchain and they are gone forever.

After you press ENTER, you will be informed of the fee and asked to confirm. Confirm the transaction to send. There are other options when it comes to sending XNV. The following command includes some of the optional features: transfer priority address amount payment_id Additional to address and amount , you now also have a priority which specifies the importance of the transaction and a payment_id which may optionally be required by the receiving party. There are 4 priority levels: default low medium high Higher priority transactions are processed before lower priority transactions, however they cost more in fees. In most cases, the default priority (automatically set when you omit the priority) is suitable. Transaction fees collected are placed into the next block and included as part of the block reward for the miner of the next block. The payment ID is an optional identifier used to label a transaction. This is most often used to distinguish who is sending funds to a particular wallet.

The other possibility is that two miners find a block simultaneously (a so called uncle block situation) and both get half the network behind 'their' chain. This creates a temporary fork and happens every so often (daily). It goes like this: Miner A and Miner B find a block almost simultaneously and start broadcasting their solution. The nodes that think block A is the right block mine as if it was and the nodes that think block B is the right one also mine as if Miner B's chain is the right one. Both chains diverge for a time until the chain is able to determine which one has the most nodes working on it (calculated from cumulative difficulty).

The preferred method is to use quicksync , as demonstrated in earlier in this guide. This is a small file which, once downloaded, will allow you to sync the full blockchain in around 20 minutes, with the command: nervad --quicksync path/to/quicksync.raw . An even faster method, especially useful if deploying NERVA to multiple machines, is to download the latest full bootstrap and import this via the command: nerva-blockchain-import --input-file path/to/mainnet.raw --verify 0 Excluding the time to download the bootstrap, the import process should take less than a minute. You'll need to run the import command twice to sync to the top block of the bootstrap. You then only need to sync the remaining blocks that weren't included in the bootstrap file. What's the difference between NERVA's quicksync method and a regular bootstrap? The bootstrap is a copy of all the blocks up to a certain point; it is possible to enable full block verification with a bootstrap file if you wish to do so. Quicksync, on the other hand, is a binary file that contains all of the chain's block hashes up to a certain height. While quicksyncing, the block hashes are compared to what is in the quicksync file rather than being computed on the fly. That saves your daemon from hashing each block itself, which is what makes the synchronization quick. It doesn't fully bypass the verification process, only the slow part of hashing the block.","title":"How do I sync even faster?"},{"location":"guides/cli/#what-are-node-blocked-messages","text":"Other nodes can be blocked from connecting to your node if they have mined an invalid block (i.e. are on a forked chain) or have possibly tampered with the code.

These measures exist to protect the integrity of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes are updated to a compatible version of the NERVA software. If you are worried about these errors, you should type status into your node. If you have connections to the network, then there is nothing to worry about.

What is Mining? Mining is the process by which transactions are validated on the blockchain. If you're new to (proof-of-work) cryptocurrencies and haven't grasped the basics of mining, that is beyond the scope of this document and there are many learning resources elsewhere. Basically though, miners compete to win a reward of XNV (consisting of the block reward, and transaction fees from any transactions in that block) by solving complex equations. Most blockchains are mainly mined by large GPU pools or ASIC mining farms. In the case of NERVA, anybody with a computer can mine, and this is a guiding principle of the project. How do I start mining? Refer to the CLI Guide or GUI Guide according to which you are using. How do I see my hashrate? In the GUI, your hashrate is shown visually. In the CLI you can use the status command. You can also use the show_hr and hide_hr commands to toggle between a constant output of your current hashrate. How will I know if I find a block? A message will be displayed in the daemon along the lines of Found block at height: xxxxxx . If you have your wallet open, you will also see the block reward as an incoming transaction. What is the current block reward? Refer to the block explorer to see the current block reward. Understanding threads A thread is simply a virtual representation of a CPU core. Modern CPU's have 2-8+ cores, with some very high end models packing 32 or more cores. Most modern CPU's also feature Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), also known as HyperThreading, which allows for multiple threads per core. Basically, if you have a quad core CPU, it will have either 4 or 8 threads depending on whether it supports SMT. You can easily check how many threads you have by looking up your CPU model. So, you should mine on all the threads, right? Probably not. Not only will it slow down anything else you try to do on the computer while mining, but it will often result in a suboptimal hashrate as well due to other hardware bottlenecks. You should experiment to find what works best for your hardware configuration. Can I really mine on any CPU? Yes, with a few caveats. The official NERVA binaries require support for the AES-NI instruction set. Practically all modern CPU's support this instruction set, but older (5+ years) models may not. It's possible to build NERVA to work without AES support, but mining isn't practical on CPU without it. For this reason it isn't officially supported. As for whether it is practical to mine on a given CPU, this will vary depending on your hardware configuration. Your CPU should be reasonably modern to be competitive. It is beneficial to have a large amount of cores and cache, and memory frequency will impact your hashrate as well, amongst other things. Some NERVA CPU benchmarks are available on Forkmaps (collected by JerMe404 ), as well as in the #benchmarks channel in Discord (search for yours or a similar CPU model). These resources should allow you to get an idea of what hashrate to expect, and thereby decide whether mining is worth it for you. What about 32-bit (i386) systems? It's possible to build 32-bit binaries yourself, but these are not officially provided or supported. 32-bit operating systems are no longer mainstream and you probably shouldn't be using one. What about non-x86 platforms? NERVA previously had an official build for Android (with mining support) but it was discontinued due to limited use and practicality. Again, you're welcome to attempt to build the software for other platforms, but it isn't an official focus at this time. (However, a mobile wallet for both Android and iOS is in development and nearing completion). Can I mine NERVA at the same time as GPU-mining another coin? Definitely! Mining NERVA is actually great way to boost the efficiency and profitability of your GPU mining rig - its CPU is mostly idle, and the electricity cost of an increased load to the CPU is negligible compared to the power consumption of your GPU(s). Depending on the requirements of the GPU mining software you're using, it may be best to leave one or more threads free for it, while mining NERVA on the remaining theads. Can I mine on a VPS / cloud server? Yes, but be aware that mining may be against the ToS of some providers. Probability of finding a block For a quick answer, you can reference Freeboard which has a live estimate of how long it will take to find a block with a hashrate of 1000H/s (simply divide/multiply this figure according to your actual hashrate). If using the GUI to mine, it also will provide an estimate based on the same mathematics. The amount of time needed to have a certain probability of finding a block can be calculated through this formula: t = time in seconds p = probability (eg 0.95 for 95% probability) h = your hashrate d = difficulty. This is only theoretical and real world outcomes will vary. In practice, it is quite common to find a number of blocks in quick succession and then not find a block for an extended period of time. Luck plays a significant role in a short timeframe, but has less and less weight the longer and more consistently you are mining for. I was finding blocks before but not anymore, is something wrong? This is a very common question and almost always just bad luck. Unless there is an error message or your hashrate has dropped (or network difficulty has risen significantly) you just need to wait. Things will average out and you will start finding blocks again. Does my chance of finding a block increase over time? All else being equal (ie if the network difficulty and your hashrate have not changed), no. You have the same likelihood each block, of finding that block. There is no advantage from having mined longer than someone else.","title":"Mining FAQ"},{"location":"guides/mining/#nerva-mining-faq","text":"Here we aim to address some of the most commonly asked questions about mining.","title":"NERVA Mining FAQ"},{"location":"guides/mining/#what-is-mining","text":"Mining is the process by which transactions are validated on the blockchain.
